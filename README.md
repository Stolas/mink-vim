Source Code Auditing plugin aimed at Vulnerability Research.
This plugin aims to replace my current workflow of using grep, rats, ctags and vim.
Besides that It is my first vim-script ever. So don't expect gold-mountains.

Release
=======
Development of this plugin is in VIM-Script, the odd language..
As a direct result of this I am just pushing the README files for now.
The entire plugin will be released when I think it is stable enough..

Usages
======
Mink exposes a few functions:
 - ShowThreats
 - ExplainThreat
 - PreviousThreat / NextThreat
 - CreateThreatTag
 - NullThreatTag

With these functions you can iterate, spot and highlight possible vulnerabilities.
